                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I'm Victoria Ozymko and I'm a senior at Northwestern University studying Cognitive Science and Computer Science.
                I am currently a part of Northwesternâ€™s SoundLab doing independent research in the Linguistics field. I've been a Research and Computer Science intern with
                an environmental consulting company called Drawbridge Solutions, and I was recently a Cybersecurity intern on the Victoria's Secret's Data Protection team.
                </p>
                <p>Outside of classes you can find me playing badminton, bouldering, playing video games, and producing music.</p>
                <p>Beginning in August 2023, I will be returning to Victoria's Secret as a full-time Cybersecurity Analyst on the Data Protection and Incident Response teams.</p>
